# A Stripboard Layout of the 'FLIP' Bernoulli Gate

This folder contains a stripboard layout for the FLIP Bernoulli Gate.

During development I made a prototype on stripboard, based on a design made in [DIYLC](https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/) :

I have decided (for the first time) to publish a stripboard layout for this project as 
it is small enough to make the stripboard layout tractable
there is a considerable tradition within synth DIY for the use of stripboard - demonstrated at [Eddy Bergman's site](https://www.eddybergman.com/)
the test/development version was close-enough to completion to make this task simple
and, finally, 
publishing a stripboard layout might make FLIP accessible to a few more potential users, who might otherwise be put off by the PCBs.

# System Schematic

First, we need to look at the schematic for the entire system (presented here as one sheet - unlike in the Eurorack folder, where there are separate sheets for the two PCBs).

The schematic is seen below (you can click on the image to open a higher-resolution graphic, which you can download):
