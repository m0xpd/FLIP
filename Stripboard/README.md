# A Stripboard Layout of the 'FLIP' Bernoulli Gate

This folder contains a stripboard layout for the FLIP Bernoulli Gate.

During development I made a prototype on stripboard, based on a design made in [DIYLC](https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/) :

I have decided (for the first time) to publish a stripboard layout for this project as 
* it is small enough to make the stripboard layout tractable
* there is a considerable tradition within synth DIY for the use of stripboard - demonstrated at [Eddy Bergman's site](https://www.eddybergman.com/)
* the test/development version was close-enough to completion to make this task simple and, finally, 
* publishing a stripboard layout might make FLIP accessible to a few more potential users, who might otherwise be put off by the PCBs.

# System Schematic

First, we need to look at the schematic for the entire system (presented here as one sheet - unlike in the Eurorack folder, where there are separate sheets for the two PCBs).

The schematic is linked below (click on the image to open the schematic at higher-resolution, which you can download):

There is a description of system operation, which references the schematic, here.

# Stripboard Layout

The prototype stripboard system (seen pictured at the head of this page) was made from a DIYLC design, which was found to have a few errors (this was my first time using the software). I corrected there errors on the prototype and on the layout, yielding the following design:
