# A Eurorack Implementation of the 'FLIP' Bernoulli Gate

The Eurorack version of Flip is implemened as a 'sandwich' consruction of two printed circuit boards.

The main board contains the majority of the electronics, realised in 4000 series CMOS logic and a quad J-FET input TL-84 op-amp.

The control board accommodates all the front panel user interface components and input/output connectors. The component board is mounted to the front panel by the probability control potentiometer and five 3.5mm jack sockets.

The two PCBs are joined electrically by two 1*8 way 0.1 inch headers, with further mechanical security provided by a pair of 3mm bolts and spacers.

# Specifications

**Width:** 

FLIP is **6 HP wide**.

**Depth:**

FLIP extends **43 mm** behind the [front panel](https://github.com/m0xpd/STRACHEY/blob/main/Hardware/Panel/README.md) when a conventional Eurorack power header **with strain relief** is inserted.

**Power Consumption:**

| Power Rail | Current |
|---|---|
| +12V | **xxmA** |
| -12V | **xxmA** |
| 5V | **0** |
