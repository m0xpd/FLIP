# FLIP Front Panel

This [folder](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/tree/main/Eurorack/Front%20Panel) contains a Eurorack front panel design for the FLIP Bernoulli Gate, expressed as a KiCad project.

There is a KiCad [Project file](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/blob/main/Eurorack/Front%20Panel/Files/Flip%20Front%20Panel.kicad_pro) and a [PCB file](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/blob/main/Eurorack/Front%20Panel/Files/Flip%20Front%20Panel.kicad_pcb).

[JLC](https://jlcpcb.com/) made my prototype panels (seen above) and did their usual great job. However, the black panel with white lettering is now VERY expensive; if you want to save money, choose white with black lettering!
