# FLIP Main Board

This folder contains details of the Main Board for the Eurorack implementation of the FLIP Bernoulli Gate, expressed as a KiCad project.


There is a KiCad [Project file](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/blob/main/Eurorack/Main%20Board/Files/Flip%20Main%20Board.kicad_pro) a [schematic file](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/blob/main/Eurorack/Main%20Board/Files/Flip%20Main%20Board.kicad_sch) and a [PCB file](https://github.com/m0xpd/FLIP/blob/main/Eurorack/Main%20Board/Files/Flip%20Main%20Board.kicad_pcb). 

[JLC](https://jlcpcb.com/) made my prototype panels (seen above) and did their usual great job.

There is also a schematic (click on the image below to open a larger version) and a BoM in Excel format ()
